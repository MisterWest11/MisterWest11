**Class Inheritance**

Uses the 'extends' keyword. A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class.

The super() method refers to the parent class. By calling the super() method, in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and get access to the parent's properties and methods.

**Arrow Functions**

Allow us to write shorter function syntax:

#Variables

There are 3 ways of declaring a variable, 'const', 'let' & 'var'.

**VAR**

if you use *var* outside of a function, it belongs to the global scope.

if you use *var* inside of a function, it belongs to that function.

if you use *var* inside of a block, i.e a for loop, the variable is still available outside of that block.

var has a function scope, not a block scope.

# Array Method

The .map() method allow you to run a function on each item in the array, returning a new array as the result. map() can be used to generate lists.
